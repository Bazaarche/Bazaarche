## Contributing

As an open source project, it is our intention that this project may receive
contributions from the community. Ultimately, our goal in the Bazaarche is to build
technology that is useful to our users.

In order to submit feedback and report bugs, we consider the best way is to open 
a GitHub issue. Whenever you do it, we ask you to include all relevant information
that will enable us and other users to replicate bugs, such as device, Android version,
